# Quark
An attempt at understanding game engines. Heavily based on TheCherno's engine, as that's the tutorial I'm learning all of this from. The more I progress the more I will hopefully modify this engine to fit my needs though. We'll see.

## To-Do list:
* Implement Photon (The Rendering API. As per the guide it only supports OpenGL, however I want to try and learn DirectX 12 and add that to the engine. That would be my first huge own contribution)
* Implement Gluon (The editor, that will hopefully come eventually)
* Implement Phonon (The Sound API)

## Immediate goals
* Get OpenGL up and running
* Get Photon into a usable state
* Perhaps write a first little game using Quark
